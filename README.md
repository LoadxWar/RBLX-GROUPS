## Using proxy
1. Add your txt to the folder
2. Go into `init.js` and change `proxyFile` to the file name of your txt, that's without the `.txt`.
3. Make sure that `proxy` is set to `true` in `init.js`
4. Be sure that the txt has a format like this: `ip:port` and then the next one on a new line.
5. Enjoy!
