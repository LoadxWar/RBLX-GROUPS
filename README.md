## Installation
1. Install NodeJs if you haven't.
2. Once you have NodeJs or already had it, open terminal/console on the folder, and run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
3. Configure your settings inside `init.js` top part (preferences)
4. Run `node .` inside your terminal/console to start.
5. Enjoy!

## Using proxy
<strong>I recommend https://proxyscrape.com/free-proxy-list (Use HTTP)</strong>
1. Add your txt to the folder
2. Go into `init.js` and change `proxyFile` to the file name of your txt, that's without the `.txt`.
3. Make sure that `proxy` is set to `true` in `init.js`
4. Be sure that the txt has a format like this: `ip:port` and then the next one on a new line.
5. Enjoy!
